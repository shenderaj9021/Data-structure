/*  Combinactors is all about number of ways of choosing some objects out of a collection (Combinations) and 
number of ways of their arrangement. (Permuatation)



 Eg - Suppose there are five members in a club let's say there names are A,B,C,D,E and one them is to b echosen as the cordinator
->  clearly any one out of them can be chosen so there  are 5 ways . Noe suppose thwo member are to be chose for the position of cordinator and coroddinator.
what is the number of ways to choose the two ?

NcR wil be use for this 
NcR = N!/(R!)(N-R)!


Permutation -  Permutation of choosing R distincs object sout of collection of N objects can be calculate using the formul
NpR = N!/(N-R)!

Rules- 
1] The Rule of Product- 
    The rule state that if there are X number of ways to choose one element from A and Y number of 
    ways to choose on element from B, then ther will be X*Y number of ways to choose tow elements , one from A and one From B

2] The Rule of Sum -
    The sum rule state that if there are X number of ways to choose on elemenbt fron A and Y number of ways to choose one element from B
    then there will be X+Y number of ways to choose one element that can belong to either A or to B.



Binomial Coefficients - 
A binomial coefficient C(n,k) also gives the number of ways ,disregarding order, 
that k objects can be chosen from among n object

NCR = NC(N-R)  (Remember pascle triangle)

NCR = (N-1)CR + (N-1)C(R-1);
